# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
### Easy

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

    -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
    1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
    0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

Return the number that I picked.

## Approach: Binary Search
```cpp
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        int myguess, response;
        do{
            myguess = left/2.0 + right/2.0;
            response = guess(myguess);
            if(response == 1){
                left = myguess+1;
            }else{
                right = myguess-1;
            }
        }while(response != 0);
        
        return myguess;
    }
};
```
