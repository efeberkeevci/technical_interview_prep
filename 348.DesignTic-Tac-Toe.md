# 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe
### Medium

Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an n x n board between two players:

    A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
    Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
    A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Implement the TicTacToe class:

    TicTacToe(int n) Initializes the object the size of the board n.
    int move(int row, int col, int player) Indicates that the player with id player plays at the cell (row, col) of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move.

 

Example 1:

Input
["TicTacToe", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move"]
[[3], [0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 1]]
Output
[null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

Explanation
TicTacToe ticTacToe = new TicTacToe(3);
Assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.
ticTacToe.move(0, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(0, 2, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(2, 2, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 1, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(2, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 0, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

ticTacToe.move(2, 1, 1); // return 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|


## Reasoning:

### BruteForce
Everytime a move occurs, make these 3 checks and return the winner accordingly

### Optimized Algo:
* Instead of checking it every time, we can check the sum for each column, row, 2 diagonals and also number of cells left in that column/row/diagonal
* If a column/row/diagonal is full but sum is neither equal to 0 or n, stop looking at that line

* Data structure to store this => array
* For example for move 0,0,1 => we update row 0, column 0 and left-to-right-diagonal since row = column

* How to determine diagonal:
    *   row = column => left diagonal
    *   sum of row+column = n-1 => right_diagonal
    
    

```cpp
class TicTacToe {
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    vector<pair<int,int>> cols;
    vector<pair<int,int>> rows;
    pair<int,int> left_to_right_diagonal;
    pair<int,int> right_to_left_diagonal;
    int size;
    
    TicTacToe(int n) {
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
            cols.push_back({n,0});
            rows.push_back({n,0});
        }
        left_to_right_diagonal = {n,0};
        right_to_left_diagonal = {n,0};
        size = n;

    }
