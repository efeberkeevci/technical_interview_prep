# 547. Number of Provinces
### Medium

There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.
Approach:
* Run DFS at each node 
* Add the visited nodes, if current node to be DFSd already visited skip this
* at every call to dfs increment one and return this value at the end

class Solution {
public:
    int findCircleNum(vector<vector<int>>& isConnected) {
        int province_count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<isConnected.size(); i++){
            if(visited.find(i) == visited.end()){
                DFS(i,isConnected);
                province_count++;
            }
        }
        return province_count;
    }
private:
    set<int> visited;
    void DFS(int node, vector<vector<int>> isConnected){
        vector<int> stack;
        stack.push_back(node);
        
        while(stack.size()>0){
            int current_node = stack.back();
            visited.insert(current_node);
            stack.pop_back();
            for(int i = 0; i<isConnected[0].size(); i++){
                if(isConnected[current_node][i] == 1 && visited.find(i) == visited.end()) stack.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        return;  
    }
