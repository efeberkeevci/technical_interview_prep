# 96. Unique Binary Search Trees
### Medium

Given an integer n, return the number of structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n.

    Example 1:

    Input: n = 3
    Output: 5

    Example 2:

    Input: n = 1
    Output: 1

## Approach:
* This wasn't very clear in the beginning but the approach to solve this problem is use dynamic programming
* If we have 3 numbers to construct a BST, we can start by picking either 1, 2 or 3
* If we pick 1 then we can only choose 2 or 3 and place in the right
* If we pick 2 then there is only one way to do so => place 1 on the left and 3 on the right
* If we pick 3 then there are 2 ways of placing 1,2. Place 1 to the left and 2 to its right and place 2 to the left and 1 to its left
* If we do these examples for n = 4, we start to see a pattern like fibonacci sequence
* F(n) = SUM(F(i-1) * F(n-i)) where i starts from 1 and goes until i = n
* We can further improve the algorithm by finding the symettry in the left and right half and cut down the number of recursive calls by half
* Furthermore, we can use memoization to utilize already computed results and cut down computation town significantly

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        vector<int> mem(n+1, -1);
        return func(n, mem);
    }
private:
    int func(int n, vector<int> & mem){
        if(n == 1 || n == 0)
            return 1;
        if(mem[n] != -1)
            return mem[n];
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n/2; i++)
            count += func(i-1, mem) * func(n-i, mem);
        count *= 2;
        if(n%2 == 1)
            count += pow(func(n/2, mem),2);
        mem[n] = count;
        return count;
        
    }
};
