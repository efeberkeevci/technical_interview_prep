# 1065. Index Pairs of a String
### Easy

Given a string text and an array of strings words, return an array of all index pairs [i, j] so that the substring text[i...j] is in words.

Return the pairs [i, j] in sorted order (i.e., sort them by their first coordinate, and in case of ties sort them by their second coordinate)

    Example 1:

    Input: text = "thestoryofleetcodeandme", words = ["story","fleet","leetcode"]
    Output: [[3,7],[9,13],[10,17]]

    Example 2:

    Input: text = "ababa", words = ["aba","ab"]
    Output: [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4]]
    Explanation: Notice that matches can overlap, see "aba" is found in [0,2] and [2,4].

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> indexPairs(string text, vector<string>& words) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++){
            int pos = -1;
            while((pos = text.find(words[i], pos+1)) != string::npos){
                vector<int> v = {pos, pos - 1 + (int)words[i].length()};
                result.push_back(v);
            }
        }
        sort(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```
