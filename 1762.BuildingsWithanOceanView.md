# 1762. Buildings With an Ocean View
### Medium

There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.

Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

## Approach:
* Start from the right end and keep track of max height building so far
* If the current building is higher than max height, push to the result array and make it max
* Reverse the array and return

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findBuildings(vector<int>& heights) {
        int max_height = heights.back();
        vector<int> result;
        result.push_back(heights.size()-1);
        
        for(int i = heights.size()-2; i >= 0; i--){
            if(heights[i] > max_height){
                result.push_back(i);
                max_height = heights[i];
            }
        }
        reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```
