# 200. Number of Islands
### Medium

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

```
Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```
##Â Approach:
* Iterate through the whole matrix
* If you find 1 explore all of the island and flip all the 1s in the island to 0s
* Increment the counter by 1 at the end of each island exploration

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& map) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<map.size();i++){
            for(int j = 0; j<map[0].size();j++){
                if(map[i][j] == '1'){
                    //cout<<"Exploring island"<<endl; 
                    explore_island(&map,i,j);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
private:
    void explore_island(vector<vector<char>> * map, int x, int y){
        //cout<<"i:"<<x<<" j:"<<y<<" "<<(*map).size()<<" "<<(*map)[0].size()<<" "<<(*map)[x][y] <<endl;
        if(x>= 0 && x<(*map).size() && y >= 0 && y<(*map)[0].size() && (*map)[x][y] == '1'){
            (*map)[x][y] = '0';
            explore_island(map,x+1,y);
            explore_island(map,x-1,y);
            explore_island(map,x,y+1);
            explore_island(map,x,y-1);
        }
        return;
    }
};
