# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
### Hard

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.

 
    Example 1:

    Input: root = [1,2,3]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

    Example 2:

    Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
    Output: 42
    Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

## Approach:
* if root is nullptr return 0
* get left result
* get right result
* find the max of 4 possibilities
    1. root->val
    2. root->val + left
    3. root->val + right
    4. root->val + left + right
* check if this max is bigger than max path sum, if so assign
* return max of the first three options mentioned above


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        helper(root);
        return max_path_sum;
    }
private:
    int max_path_sum = INT_MIN;
    int helper(TreeNode * root){
        if(root == nullptr)
            return 0;
        
        int left = helper(root->left);//check for long
        int right = helper(root->right);
        int cur_max = max(root->val, max(root->val + left, max(root->val + right, root->val + left + right)));
        if(cur_max > max_path_sum)
            max_path_sum = cur_max;
        
        return max(root->val, max(root->val + left, root->val + right));
    }
};
