###Â 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60
# Medium

You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60

Example 2:

Input: time = [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.


Approach: Similar to 2Sum
Need to look at all pairs? => time limit exceeded

Pre process the array by taking the modulo of every item Then Use hash set like 2 sum

Ex:30,20,150,100,40 => 30,20,30,40,40

30-30
20-40
20-40

Create a frequency map with modulos
30 : 2
20 : 1
40 : 2

0, 30 special numbers since they are each others compliment => count += freqC2
In all other ones, we need to have a different count for this one to halve later
    look for its compliment
    count += freq1 * freq2
Return count
    
```cpp
class Solution {

public:
    int numPairsDivisibleBy60(vector<int>& time) {
        map<int,int> mem;
        for(int i = 0; i<time.size(); i++){
            mem[time[i]%60]++;
        }
        
        map<int,int>::iterator it;
        int self_complemantary_count = 0;
        int pair_complemantary_count = 0;
        map<int,int>::iterator pair;
        for(it = mem.begin(); it != mem.end(); it++){
            //0 and 30 case
            if(it->first == 0 || it ->first == 30)
                self_complemantary_count += (it->second * (it->second-1) / 2);
            //Other cases
            else{
                if((pair = mem.find(60-(it->first))) != mem.end())
                    pair_complemantary_count += pair->second * it->second;
            }
            
        }
        return self_complemantary_count + pair_complemantary_count/2;
    }    
};

```
