# 57. Insert Interval
### Medium

Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

 

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

Approach:
* Insert the new interval to the correct place that doesn't break the ascending sorted behaviour of the intervals
* Start from the interval to the left and merge as much as you can and then return the intervals that way

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> insert(vector<vector<int>> intervals, vector<int> interval){
        //Insert the new interval to its correct place in the sorted order
        int i = 0;
        while(i < intervals.size() && intervals[i][0] <= interval[0]){
            i++;
        }
        intervals.insert(intervals.begin()+i, interval);

        i = max(0, i-1);
        mergeIntervals(&intervals, i);
        return intervals;
    }

private:
    void mergeIntervals(vector<vector<int>> *intervals ,int begin){
        int i = begin;
        while(i < (*intervals).size()-1){
            int end_time = (*intervals)[i][1];
            int j = i+1;
            while(j < (*intervals).size() && end_time >= (*intervals)[j][0]){
                end_time = max(end_time, (*intervals)[j][1]);
                j++;
            }
            (*intervals)[i][1] = end_time;
            (*intervals).erase((*intervals).begin()+i+1, (*intervals).begin()+j);
            i++;
        }
        
        return;

    }
};
```
