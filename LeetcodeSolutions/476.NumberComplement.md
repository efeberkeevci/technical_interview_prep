# 476. Number Complement
### Easy

Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Example 1:
Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Example 2:
Input: num = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

Approach:
* Find the number of bits of num by shifting to right by one until num is 0
* answer is pow(2,num_bits)-1

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        //Find the number of bits of num
        //answer is pow(2,num_bits)-1
        int temp = num;
        int num_of_bits = 0;
        while(temp>0){
            temp >>=1;
            num_of_bits++;
        }
        return pow(2,num_of_bits)-num-1;
    }
};
```
