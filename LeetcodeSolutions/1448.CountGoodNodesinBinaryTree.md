# 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree
### Medium

Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.

Approach:
* Root is a good node for sure
* Recurse on left and right subtree 
* Need to pass the largest value on the path so far
* If the cur val is larger than the largest on the path so far make that cur val the largest and keep recursion
*     
* BASE CASE
    * if null return 0
    * if left and right null return 1
* RECURSIVE CASE
    * If the cur val is larger than the largest on the path so far make that cur val the largest and keep recursion

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int goodNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        return helper(root, INT_MIN);    
    }
private:
    int helper(TreeNode * root, int largest_so_far){
        if(root == nullptr) return 0;
        int count = 0;
        if(root->val >= largest_so_far){
            count += helper(root->left, root->val) + helper(root->right, root->val) + 1;
        }
        else{
            count += helper(root->left, largest_so_far) + helper(root->right, largest_so_far);
        }
        return count;
    }
};
