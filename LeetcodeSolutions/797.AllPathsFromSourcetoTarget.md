# 797. All Paths From Source to Target
###Â Medium

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1 and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i (i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).

    Example 1:

    Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
    Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
    Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.

    Example 2:

    Input: graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]
    Output: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]

## Approach: Backtracking
* The problem states that the graph is acyclic, therefore this makes our job much easier
* Start from node 0 and go to the connected nodes from there until you reach the n-1th node
* At this point create a 2d vector and push a vector with a single element(n-1) to this 2d vector and return
* For every other node, collect and merge all the paths so far and append the current node to the paths and return

public:
    vector<vector<int>> allPathsSourceTarget(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        vector<vector<int>> res =  helper(graph,0);
        for(int i = 0; i<res.size(); i++){
            reverse(res[i].begin(), res[i].end());
        }
        return res;
    }
private:
    vector<vector<int>> helper(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int curnode) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        if(curnode == graph.size()-1){
            vector<int> v = {curnode};
            result.push_back(v);
            return result;
        }else{
            for(int i = 0; i<graph[curnode].size(); i++){
                vector<vector<int>> subresult = helper(graph,graph[curnode][i]);
                result.insert(result.end(), subresult.begin(), subresult.end());
            }
            for(int i = 0; i<result.size(); i++){
                result[i].push_back(curnode);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
