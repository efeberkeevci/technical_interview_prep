# 270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value
### Easy

Given the root of a binary search tree and a target value, return the value in the BST that is closest to the target.


Example 1:

Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286
Output: 4

Approach:
* If the target is smaller than root look at the closest value on the left subtree
* If the target is larger than root look at the closest value on the right subtree
* Compare the root value with what subtree returns and compare this root val, return the one that is closer

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int closestValue(TreeNode* root, double target) {
        if(root == nullptr) return INT_MAX;
        if(target < root->val){
            int left = closestValue(root->left, target);
            double diff1 = abs(left-target);
            double diff2 = abs(root->val - target);
            return diff1 < diff2 ? left : root->val;
            
        }
        int right = closestValue(root->right, target);
        double diff1 = abs(right-target);
        double diff2 = abs(root->val - target);
        return diff1 < diff2 ? right : root->val;
        
    }
};
```
