# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
### Easy

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

```c
int maxProfit(int* prices, int pricesSize){
    //find smallest as you go
    //find the biggest difference after that
    int smallest = 9999;
    int largest_after_smallest = prices[0];
    int largest_diff = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i<pricesSize; i++){
        if(prices[i]<smallest){
            smallest=prices[i];
            largest_after_smallest = prices[i];
        }
        if(prices[i]>largest_after_smallest) largest_after_smallest = prices[i];
        if(largest_after_smallest - smallest > largest_diff)largest_diff = largest_after_smallest - smallest;
    }
    return largest_diff;
}
