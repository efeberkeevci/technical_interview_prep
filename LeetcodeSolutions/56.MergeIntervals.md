# 56. Merge Intervals
###Â Medium

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

 

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

Approach: 
* Sort the array by increasing interval start time
* Starting from the first interval, compare the end time of the interval to the next interval's beginning time.
* If so, make the end time of the first interval equal to the max of its current value and next intervals end time
* Keep doing this until the compared interval's beginning time is greater than first interval's end time
* Erase all the intervals that are merged and advance to the next interval whose beginning time is greater than prev's interval's end time
```cpp
class Solution {

private:
       static bool sort_by_starting_time(const vector<int> i1, const vector<int> i2){
           if(i1[0] == i2[0]) return i1[1] < i2[1];
           return i1[0] < i2[0];
    }
public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        int i = 0;
        sort(intervals.begin(),intervals.end());
        while(i < intervals.size()-1){
            int cur_interval_end = intervals[i][1];
            int j = i+1;
            while(j < intervals.size() && cur_interval_end >= intervals[j][0]){
                cur_interval_end = max(intervals[j++][1],cur_interval_end);
            }

            intervals[i][1] = cur_interval_end;
            intervals.erase(intervals.begin()+i+1, intervals.begin()+j);
            i++;
        }
        return intervals;
    }
};
