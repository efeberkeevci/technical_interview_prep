# 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings
### Medium

Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same.

In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.
Algorithm:
* Base case : if both strings are empty return 0, no chars to delete to match strings
* If last characters are equal than delete last characters of both strings and call the function with the pruned strings
* If they are not equal get the minimum of 2 recursive calls and add one and return
  *   one with str1 trimmed and str2 not
  *   the other one with str2 trimmed and str1 not
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int mem[1000][1000] = {0};
        return deletionDistance(word1,word2,word1.length(), word2.length(), mem);
    }
private:
  int deletionDistance( const string& str1, const string& str2, int i1, int i2, int mem[1000][1000]) {
      int result;
      if(i1 == 0 || i2 == 0 ) return i1 + i2;
      if(mem[i1][i2]>0) return mem[i1][i2];


      if(str1[i1-1] == str2[i2-1]){
        result = deletionDistance(str1,str2,i1-1,i2-1,mem);
        goto res;
      }
        result = 1+ min(deletionDistance(str1,str2,i1-1,i2,mem),
                        deletionDistance(str1,str2,i1,i2-1,mem));
    res:
        mem[i1][i2] = result;
        return result;
  }
};
