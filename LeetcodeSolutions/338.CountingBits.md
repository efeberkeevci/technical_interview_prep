# 338. Counting Bits
### Easy

Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

    Example 1:

    Input: n = 2
    Output: [0,1,1]
    Explanation:
    0 --> 0
    1 --> 1
    2 --> 10

    Example 2:

    Input: n = 5
    Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
    Explanation:
    0 --> 0
    1 --> 1
    2 --> 10
    3 --> 11
    4 --> 100
    5 --> 101

## Approach
* The number of 1s of a number is equal to minimum number of bits required to represent that number - number of 1s in its negated number
* In other way num_of_1s(n) = total_bits - result[pow(2,total_bits) -1 - n])
* Base Case => 0 has 0 bits

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        vector<int> result(1,0); //initialize the first element as zero since 0 has 0 1bit
        int total_bits = 1; // represents minimum number of bits required to represent current number i
        
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            if(i * 2 == pow(2,total_bits+1)) // increment minimum number of bits required when reached the next power of 2
                total_bits++;
            result.push_back(total_bits - result[pow(2,total_bits) -1 - i]);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        vector<int> res;
        for(int i = 0; i<=n; i++){
            res.push_back(count_bits(i));
        }
        return res;
    }
private:
    int count_bits(int n){
        int n_original = n;
        int count = 0;
        while(n>0){
            if( n == (n>>1)*2 +1)count++;
            n = n>>1;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
