# 249. Group Shifted Strings
### Medium

We can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter.

    For example, "abc" can be shifted to be "bcd".

We can keep shifting the string to form a sequence.

    For example, we can keep shifting "abc" to form the sequence: "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz".

Given an array of strings strings, group all strings[i] that belong to the same shifting sequence. You may return the answer in any order.

    Example 1:

    Input: strings = ["abc","bcd","acef","xyz","az","ba","a","z"]
    Output: [["acef"],["a","z"],["abc","bcd","xyz"],["az","ba"]]

Approach:
* In order to belong to the same shifting sequence, two strings need to have
    1. same length
    2. same distance sequence between its characters
* I solved the problem by using a hashmap 
    * with the key being the distance sequence between a string's characters
    * value being all strings with this sequence
* For the key generation function, if the distance between two chars is the negative than add 26(NUM OF LETTERS IN THE ALPHABET)
* For each string in strings vector, we push the string with its generated key to the hash table
* In the end, we get an iterator to the hash table and add vectors to the result one by one.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupStrings(vector<string>& strings) {
        vector<vector<string>> result;
        map<string, vector<string>> mem;
        
        //Insert each string to the map with its generated key
        for(int i = 0; i<strings.size(); i++){
            mem[make_key(strings[i])].push_back(strings[i]);
        }
        
        //Get an iterator to the map and push each value vector to the result and return in the end
        map<string,vector<string>>::iterator it;
        for(it = mem.begin(); it != mem.end(); it++){
            result.push_back(it->second);
        }
        return result;
    }
private:
    string make_key(string s){
        string key = "";
        int diff;
        for(int i = 0; i<s.length()-1; i++){
            diff = s[i] - s[i+1];
            if(diff < 0)  
                diff += 26;
            key += to_string(diff) + ".";
        }
        return key;
    }
};
