# 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves
### Medium

Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:

    The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
    The depth of the root of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1.
    The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes, is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.

Note: This question is the same as 865: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subtree-with-all-the-deepest-nodes/

    Example 1:

    Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
    Output: [2,7,4]
    Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
    The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree.
    Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.

    Example 2:

    Input: root = [1]
    Output: [1]
    Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree, and it's the lca of itself.

    Example 3:

    Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
    Output: [2]
    Explanation: The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is itself.

## Approach: O(n) runtime
* Traverse all the tree to determine the max depth of the leaf nodes
* Then starting from the root again
    * if leaf node return this node
    * if leaf but not deepest return null
    * else 
        * if both leaf then this node is the lca
        * if one of them is lca return that
        * if none return nullptr
   

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        find_max_depth(root, 0);
        return helper(root,0);
    }
private:
    int max_depth = 0;
    void find_max_depth(TreeNode * root, int depth){
        if(root == nullptr)
            return;
        else if(root->left == nullptr  && root->right == nullptr && depth > max_depth){
                max_depth = depth;
                return;
            }
        
        find_max_depth(root->left, depth+1);
        find_max_depth(root->right, depth+1);
        return;
    }
    
    TreeNode * helper(TreeNode * root, int depth){
        if(root == nullptr)
            return nullptr;
        if(root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr){
            if(depth == max_depth)
                return root;
            else
                return nullptr;
        }
        else{
            TreeNode * left = helper(root->left, depth+1);
            TreeNode * right = helper(root->right, depth+1);
            if(left != nullptr && right!= nullptr)
                return root;
            else if(left != nullptr)
                return left;
            else if(right != nullptr)
                return right;
            else
                return nullptr;
        }
    }
};
```
