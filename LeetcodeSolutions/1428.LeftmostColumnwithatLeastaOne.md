# 1428. Leftmost Column with at Least a One
### Medium

(This problem is an interactive problem.)

A row-sorted binary matrix means that all elements are 0 or 1 and each row of the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given a row-sorted binary matrix binaryMatrix, return the index (0-indexed) of the leftmost column with a 1 in it. If such an index does not exist, return -1.

You can't access the Binary Matrix directly. You may only access the matrix using a BinaryMatrix interface:

    BinaryMatrix.get(row, col) returns the element of the matrix at index (row, col) (0-indexed).
    BinaryMatrix.dimensions() returns the dimensions of the matrix as a list of 2 elements [rows, cols], which means the matrix is rows x cols.

Submissions making more than 1000 calls to BinaryMatrix.get will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

For custom testing purposes, the input will be the entire binary matrix mat. You will not have access to the binary matrix directly.
    Example 2:
    Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]
    Output: 1

    Example 3:

    Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,0]]
    Output: -1

    Example 4:

    Input: mat = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,1],[0,1,1,1]]
    Output: 1

## Approach:
### Brute Force
* start from the first col, look for 1 if not advance to the next col, return earliest col
* O(m*n) => wrong answer 


### Binary Search
1. for each row, find the first 1 via binary search and record it if it is minimum
2. then start the next index from the col = min and 
    * if 0 go to next row
    * if not do step1

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int leftMostColumnWithOne(BinaryMatrix &binaryMatrix) {
        vector<int> dims = binaryMatrix.dimensions();
        int min = dims[1] - 1;
        bool set_flag = false;
        
        for(int i = 0; i<dims[0]; i++){
            if(binaryMatrix.get(i,min) == 0)
                continue;
            else{
                int begin = 0; 
                int end = min;
                int mid;
                while(begin <= end){
                    mid = (begin+end)/2;
                    if(binaryMatrix.get(i,mid) == 1){
                        if(mid == 0 || (mid > 0 && binaryMatrix.get(i,mid-1) == 0)){
                            set_flag = true;
                            min = mid;
                            break;
                        }
                        else{
                            end = mid-1;
                        }
                    }else{
                        begin = mid+1;
                    }
                        
                }
            }
        }
        return set_flag ? min : -1;
    }
};
