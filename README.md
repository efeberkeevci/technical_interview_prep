# Data Structures and Algorithm Questions Solved
* This repo containes 300+ Leetcode questions I solved up until now.
* In the root directory you can see my approaches to the various Leetcode questions that I solved and saved with its question number and title
* Furthermore, I included my implementation of fundemental data structures and algorithms in the "Other" directory. 
* This repo helps me observe my progress over time in my ability to solve DSA questions.
* I started solving these questions to prepare for my technical interviews but after spending more and more time, I developed a passion for solving them.
* Hopefully, my approaches will be useful to some other people out there :)
