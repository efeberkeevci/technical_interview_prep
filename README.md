# Technical Interview Prep
* This repo will have my technical interview journey.
* I will share the questions I solve, things I read and videos that I find useful.
* This is like a diary to me in my journey to prepeare for my upcoming interviews.
* But more importantly, I will enjoy learning and practicing the art of computing more and more every day.
* Hopefully, it will be useful to some other people out there :)
