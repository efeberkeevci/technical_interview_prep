# 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary
### Easy

In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

    Example 1:

    Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    Output: true
    Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

    Example 2:

    Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
    Output: false
    Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.

    Example 3:

    Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    Output: false
    Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).


## Approach:
* Go through each adjacent pair of words and check if their sorted according to the alien order
* if not sorted at any pair return false
* otherwise return true

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAlienSorted(vector<string>& words, string order) {
        unordered_map<char,int> alphabet;
        for(int i = 0; i < order.length(); i++)
            alphabet[order[i]] = i;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < words.size()-1; i++){
            if(!compare_order(words[i], words[i+1], alphabet))
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
private:
    bool compare_order(const string s1, const string s2, unordered_map<char,int> & alphabet){
        int i = 0;
            while(i < min(s1.length(), s2.length())){
                if(s1[i] == s2[i])
                    i++;
                else
                    return (alphabet[s1[i]] < alphabet[s2[i]]);
            }
            if(s1.length() <= s2.length())
                return true;
            else
                return false;
    }
};
```
