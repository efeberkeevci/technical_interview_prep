# 696. Count Binary Substrings
### Easy

Give a binary string s, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

    Example 1:

    Input: s = "00110011"
    Output: 6
    Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
    Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
    Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.

    Example 2:

    Input: s = "10101"
    Output: 4
    Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.

## Approach:
* Idea: Keep track of streaks of 1s and 0s and then the number of substrings we can form with these 2 streaks is minimum of the length of the current and previous streak
* Init sum as integer equal to 0. Declare prev and cur as a pair of char and int. Make cur equal to the pair of the first char and count of 1
* go through each char from the second character of the string, until the end
* whenever current character is different than the previous character
    * add the minimum of current and prev count to the total sum
    * make prev equal to cur
    * make cur equal to the current char and count as 1
* else, if the current character is the same as the previous, the streak for that character continues, thus increase the count of cur
* in the end take the min of prev and cur's count
* return the sum
* Time complexity = O(n), single pass
* Space complexity = O(1)
* Optimal solution since we need to look at each char at least once

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countBinarySubstrings(string s) {
        int sum = 0;
        pair<char,int> prev = {'0', 0};
        pair<char,int> cur = {s[0],1};
        
        int i = 1;
        while(i < s.length()){
            if(s[i] != cur.first){
                sum += min(prev.second, cur.second);
                prev = cur;
                cur = {s[i],1};
            }else{
                cur.second++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        sum += min(prev.second, cur.second);
        return sum;
    }
};
```
