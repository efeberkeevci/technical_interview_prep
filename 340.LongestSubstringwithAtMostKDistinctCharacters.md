# 340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters
### Medium

Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s that contains at most k distinct characters.

    Example 1:

    Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The substring is "ece" with length 3.

    Example 2:

    Input: s = "aa", k = 1
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The substring is "aa" with length 2.

## Approach: sliding window with unordered_map
* similar to longest substring without repeating characters
* While unique characters are smaller than or equal to k, grow the substring window to the right
* when it goes out of window, get the length and make it max length if it is longer than what has been found so far
* furthermore, shrink the window from left until num unique characters go back to k
* repeat the process until we reach the end
* Time Complexity : O (nk) where n i slength of the string and k is k
* Space Complexity O(k)
* Since k is at most 50 which can be evaluated as constant Time Complexity is O(n) and Space Complexity is O(1)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(string s, int k) {
        if(k == 0)
            return 0;
        unordered_map<char,int> freq;
        int max_length = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int left = 0;
        
        while(i < s.length()){  
            if(freq.find(s[i]) != freq.end()){
                freq[s[i]]++;
                i++;
            }
            else{
                if(k == freq.size()){
                    max_length = max(max_length, i-left);
                    while(freq.size() == k && left < s.length()){
                        if(freq[s[left]] == 1)
                            freq.erase(s[left]);
                        else
                            freq[s[left]]--;
                        left++;
                    }
                }
                else{
                    freq[s[i]]++;
                    i++;
                }
            }
