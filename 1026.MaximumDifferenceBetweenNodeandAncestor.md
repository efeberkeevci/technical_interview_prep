# 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor
### Medium

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.

A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b.

    Example 1:

    Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
    Output: 7
    Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
    |8 - 3| = 5
    |3 - 7| = 4
    |8 - 1| = 7
    |10 - 13| = 3
    Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.

##Â Approach
* Since we are only interested in the absolute difference, we ony need to keep track of min and max ancestor so far in the recursion
* Take the diff and check against the max difference
* Update the min and max ancestor value with current root value and recurse on child nodes

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxAncestorDiff(TreeNode* root) {
        helper(root, root->val, root->val);
        return max_diff;
    }
private:
    int max_diff = 0;
    void helper(TreeNode * root, int min_anc, int max_anc){
        if(root == nullptr)
            return;
        int cur_max_diff = max(abs(min_anc-root->val), abs(max_anc-root->val));
        if(cur_max_diff > max_diff)
            max_diff = cur_max_diff;
        min_anc = min(min_anc, root->val);
        max_anc = max(max_anc, root->val);
        helper(root->left, min_anc, max_anc);
        helper(root->right, min_anc, max_anc);
        return;
    }
};
```

## Brute Force Algorithm
* Pass a list of integers aka the values of ancestor to the child nodes and then compute diff with all of them
* Time Complexity => O(n^2) worst case if BT is linked list like
* Space Complexity => O(n*logn) worst case if BT is linked list like
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxAncestorDiff(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> ancestors = {root->val};
        helper(root->left, ancestors);
        helper(root->right, ancestors);
        return max_diff;
    }
private:
    int max_diff = 0;
    void helper(TreeNode * root, vector<int> ancestors){
        if(root == nullptr)
            return;
        for(int i = 0; i < ancestors.size(); i++){
            if(abs(ancestors[i] - root->val) > max_diff)
                max_diff = abs(ancestors[i] - root->val);
        }
        ancestors.push_back(root->val);
        helper(root->left, ancestors);
        helper(root->right, ancestors);
    }
};
```
