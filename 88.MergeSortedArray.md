# 88. Merge Sorted Array
### Easy

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

 
## Approach:
* Have 2 pointers one pointing to the mth element at nums1 and the other last element at nums2
* compare them. place the bigger one to the index1 +index2th index
* decrement the pointer with bigger val
* do this until one of the pointers becomes negative
* At this point, if the pointer reached negative is the nums2 pointer do nothing
* if it is the nums1 pointer then fill the rest of the nums1 with the elements that is on to the left of nums2 pointer, inclusive


Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        int i1 = m-1;
        int i2 = n-1;
        while(i1 >= 0 && i2 >= 0){
            if(nums1[i1] > nums2[i2]){
                nums1[i1+i2+1] = nums1[i1];
                i1--;
            }
                
            else{
                nums1[i1+i2+1] = nums2[i2];
                i2--;
            }
                
        }
        if(i1 < 0){
            //put the rest of i2 elements
            while(i2 >= 0){
                nums1[i1+i2+1] = nums2[i2];
                i2--;
            }    
        }
        //else do nothing because they are already in place
        return;
    }
};

```
