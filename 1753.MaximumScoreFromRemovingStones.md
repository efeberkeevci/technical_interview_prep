# 1753. Maximum Score From Removing Stones
### Medium

You are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes a​​​​​​, b,​​​​​​ and c​​​​​​ respectively. Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add 1 point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).

Given three integers a​​​​​, b,​​​​​ and c​​​​​, return the maximum score you can get.

 

    Example 1:

    Input: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
    - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)
    - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)
    - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
    - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
    - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
    - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
    There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.

    Example 2:

    Input: a = 4, b = 4, c = 6
    Output: 7
    Explanation: The starting state is (4, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
    - Take from 1st and 2nd piles, state is now (3, 3, 6)
    - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (2, 3, 5)
    - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 3, 4)
    - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
    - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
    - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
    - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
    There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 7 points.

## Approach:
* Create a heap and push a,b,c
* While 2 nonzero lots left
    * Pick the top 2 lots, decrement them and push back to heap
    * Increment counter 1
* Return counter

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumScore(int a, int b, int c) {
        priority_queue<int> heap;
        heap.push(a);
        heap.push(b);
        heap.push(c);
        
        int count = 0;
        int first, second;
        
        while(heap.top() > 0){
            first = heap.top();
            heap.pop();
            second = heap.top();
            heap.pop();
            
            if(second == 0 || first == 0)
                break;
            
            first--;
            second--;
            heap.push(first);
            heap.push(second);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
