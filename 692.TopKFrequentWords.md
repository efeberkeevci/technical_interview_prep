# 692. Top K Frequent Words
### Medium

Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

    Example 1:

    Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
    Output: ["i","love"]
    Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
    Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

    Example 2:

    Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
    Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
    Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> topKFrequent(vector<string>& words, int k) {
        unordered_map<string,int> freq;
        for(string s : words)
            freq[s]++;
        
        auto sort_by_freq = [](const pair<string,int> p1, const pair<string,int> p2){
            if(p1.second != p2.second)
                return p1.second < p2.second;
            else
                return p1.first > p2.first;
        };
        
        priority_queue<pair<string,int>, vector<pair<string,int>>, decltype(sort_by_freq)> pq(sort_by_freq);
        for(auto p : freq)
            pq.push(p);
        
        vector<string> result;
        while(k > 0){
            result.push_back(pq.top().first);
            pq.pop();
            k--;
        }
        return result;
            
    }
};
