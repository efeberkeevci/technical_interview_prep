# 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram
### Medium

Given two equal-size strings s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.

Return the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s.

An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

    Example 1:
    Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.

    Example 2:
    Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.

## Approach:
* Create two arrays of integers of size 26 and fill with 0s
* For each string map the num of occurance of chars to this array
* Record the number of common characters and return length of one string minus this num of common characters


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(string s, string t) {
        int freqs[26];
        int freqt[26];
        for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++){
            freqs[i] = 0;
            freqt[i] = 0;
        }
        for(char c : s)
            freqs[c-'a']++;
        for(char c : t)
            freqt[c-'a']++;
        
        int num_of_common_chars = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
            num_of_common_chars += min(freqt[i], freqs[i]);
        
        return t.length() - num_of_common_chars;
    }
};
```
