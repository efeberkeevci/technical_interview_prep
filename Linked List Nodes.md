# Linked List Notes

To refresh my knowledge I watched the following video:
* (https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures-optimizing-performance/core-linked-lists-vs-arrays-rjBs9) => Linked List vs Array List

and read through
* (https://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/int/sx8.html) => Pointer Arithmetic

## Notes
    * Use -> when accessing a variable through a pointer, use . when you are directly accessing the variable inside the structure
