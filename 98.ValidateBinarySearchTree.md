# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree
### Medium

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Approach:
* For a tree to be a valid BST, the subtree nodes have to be inside certain range of minimum and maximum that is determined by its ancestor nodes
* If the all nodes are inside their own ranges, then the tree is a BST, else it is not

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        return helper(root, LLONG_MIN, LLONG_MAX);
    }
private:
    bool helper(TreeNode * root, long long min_bound, long long max_bound){
        if(root == nullptr)
            return true;
        if(root->val <= min_bound || root->val >= max_bound)
            return false;
        long long new_max_bound  = max_bound > root->val ? root->val : max_bound;
        long long new_min_bound  = min_bound < root->val ? root->val : min_bound;
           
        return helper(root->left, min_bound, new_max_bound) && helper(root->right, new_min_bound , max_bound);
    }
};
```
