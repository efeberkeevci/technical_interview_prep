# 2. Add Two Numbers
### Medium

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

 

Example 1:

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

Approach:
* create variables sum = 0, carry = 0, create an empty list called reslist, create a pointer to the head of reslist
* create a while loop that runs from the beginning of the lists until we reach the end of both lists
    * sum = carry
    * if we havent reached the end of list 1 add its value to sum
    * if we havent reached the end of list 2 add its value to sum
    * make the value current value of the reslist node equal to sum mod 10
    * carry is 1 if sum is bigger than or equal to 10
    * else carry is 0
    * if we havent reached the end of the loop create the next node and advance the pointer to that node
* if carry is 1 at the end of the while loop
    * create a new node and make its value 1
* return head of reslist
    

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };

public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        int sum = 0;
        int carry = 0;
        ListNode * retlist = new ListNode();
        ListNode * head = retlist;
        while(l1 != nullptr || l2 != nullptr){
            sum = carry;
            
            if(l1 != nullptr){
                sum += l1->val;
                l1 = l1->next;
            }
                
            if(l2 != nullptr){
                sum += l2->val;
                l2 = l2->next;
            }
                
            retlist->val = sum%10;
            carry = sum >=10 ? 1 : 0;
            if(l1 != nullptr || l2 != nullptr){
                retlist->next = new ListNode();
                retlist = retlist->next;                
            }
        }
        if(carry == 1)
            retlist->next = new ListNode(1);

        return head;
    }
};
