# 785. Is Graph Bipartite?
### Medium

There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

    There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
    There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
    If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
    The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.

A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

    Example 1:

    Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
    Output: false
    Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.

    Example 2:

    Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
    Output: true
    Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.

## Approach: Is Graph 2 Colorable with DFS
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    enum Color {RED, BLUE, UNDECLARED};
    bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        unordered_set<int> red, blue;
        stack<int> q;
        q.push(0);
        red.insert(0);
        
        while(!q.empty()){
            int cur = q.top();
            Color cur_color = UNDECLARED;
            q.pop();
            for(int i = 0; i < graph[cur].size(); i++){
                if(red.find(graph[cur][i]) != red.end()){
                    if(cur_color == UNDECLARED)
                        cur_color = RED;
                    else if(cur_color == BLUE)
                        return false;
                }else if(blue.find(graph[cur][i]) != blue.end()){
                    if(cur_color == UNDECLARED)
                        cur_color = BLUE;
                    else if(cur_color == RED)
                        return false;
                }else{
                    q.push(graph[cur][i]);
                }
            }
            if(cur_color == RED)
                blue.insert(cur);
            else
                red.insert(cur);
            if(q.empty() && red.size() + blue.size() < graph.size()){
                for(int i = 0; i < graph.size(); i++){
                    if(red.find(i) == red.end() && blue.find(i) == blue.end()){
                        q.push(i);
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
