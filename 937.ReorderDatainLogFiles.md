# 937. Reorder Data in Log Files
### Easy

You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.

There are two types of logs:

    Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
    Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.

Reorder these logs so that:

    The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
    The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
    The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.

Return the final order of the logs.

    Example 1:

    Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
    Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
    Explanation:
    The letter-log contents are all different, so their ordering is "art can", "art zero", "own kit dig".
    The digit-logs have a relative order of "dig1 8 1 5 1", "dig2 3 6".

    Example 2:

    Input: logs = ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
    Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]

## Approach:
* Create a vector of pair of strings to store the letter logs as identifier and content
* Create a vector of strings to store digit_logs
* Go through every log from the input and push back to corresponding vectors 
* Sort the letter logs as instructed
* Go through the letter logs vector and add to result vector after concating identifier and content
* Append the digit logs to the result vector and return

    vector<string> reorderLogFiles(vector<string>& logs) {
        vector<pair<string,string>> letter_logs;
        vector<string> digit_logs;
        
        for(string log : logs){
            if(is_letter_log(log)){
                string identifier, content;
                int pos = log.find(" ");
                identifier = log.substr(0, pos);
                content = log.substr(pos+1, log.length() - pos -1);
                letter_logs.push_back({identifier, content});
            }else
                digit_logs.push_back(log);      
        }
        
        sort(letter_logs.begin(), letter_logs.end(), letter_log_sort);
        logs.clear();
        for(auto log : letter_logs){
            logs.push_back(log.first + " " + log.second);
        }
        logs.insert(logs.end(), digit_logs.begin(), digit_logs.end());
        return logs;
