# 366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree
### Medium

Given the root of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:
Collect all the leaf nodes.
Remove all the leaf nodes.
Repeat until the tree is empty.

 

    Example 1:

    Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
    Explanation:
    [[3,5,4],[2],[1]] and [[3,4,5],[2],[1]] are also considered correct answers since per each level it does not matter the order on which elements are returned.

## Approach: Recursion
* recursive function
    * BASE CASE: if root is null return 0
    RECURSIVE STEP:
    * get the max from left and right and push the current node to that set, create and add if doesnt exist, return max+1
        
* Time Complexity O(n), single pass
* Space Complexity O(n)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        helper(root);
        return result;
    }
private:
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    int helper(TreeNode * root){
        if(root == nullptr)
            return 0;
        int left = helper(root->left);
        int right = helper(root->right);
        int bracket = max(left, right);
        if(result.size() <= bracket)
            result.push_back({});
        result[bracket].push_back(root->val);
        return bracket+1;
    }
};
```
