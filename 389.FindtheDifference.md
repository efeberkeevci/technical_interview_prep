# 389. Find the Difference
### Easy

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

## HashMap Approach
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char,int> mem;
        for(char c : t)
            mem[c]++;
        for(char c : s){
            if(mem[c] == 1)
                mem.erase(c);
            else
                mem[c]--;
        }
        auto it = mem.begin();
        return it->first;
        
    }
};
```
