# 1668. Maximum Repeating Substring
### Easy

For a string sequence, a string word is k-repeating if word concatenated k times is a substring of sequence. The word's maximum k-repeating value is the highest value k where word is k-repeating in sequence. If word is not a substring of sequence, word's maximum k-repeating value is 0.

Given strings sequence and word, return the maximum k-repeating value of word in sequence.
    Example 1:

    Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: "abab" is a substring in "ababc".

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxRepeating(string sequence, string word) {
        string search_word = word;
        int i = 0;
        while(sequence.find(search_word) != string::npos){
            i++;
            search_word += word;
        }
        return i;
    }
};
```
