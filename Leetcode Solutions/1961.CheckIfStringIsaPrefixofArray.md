# 1961. Check If String Is a Prefix of Array
### Easy

Given a string s and an array of strings words, determine whether s is a prefix string of words.

A string s is a prefix string of words if s can be made by concatenating the first k strings in words for some positive k no larger than words.length.

Return true if s is a prefix string of words, or false otherwise.


Example 1:

Input: s = "iloveleetcode", words = ["i","love","leetcode","apples"]
Output: true
Explanation:
s can be made by concatenating "i", "love", and "leetcode" together.

Example 2:

Input: s = "iloveleetcode", words = ["apples","i","love","leetcode"]
Output: false
Explanation:
It is impossible to make s using a prefix of arr.

Approach:
* Starting from the first word in words, look if it exists in s
* If not return false
* If exists, then erase the length of the word from the beginning of s
* Continue doing this until s is empty or all the words are traversed
* If s is empty return true, false otherwise

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPrefixString(string s, vector<string>& words) {
        int i = 0;
        while(i < words.size() && s.length() > 0){
           
            if(s.find(words[i]) == string::npos) return false;
            else{
                s.erase(0,words[i].length());
            }
            i++;
        }
        return s.size() == 0;
    }
};

```
