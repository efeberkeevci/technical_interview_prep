# 791. Custom Sort String
### Medium

You are given two strings order and s. All the words of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.

 

    Example 1:

    Input: order = "cba", s = "abcd"
    Output: "cbad"
    Explanation: 
    "a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". 
    Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
Approach:
* For each char in s
    * find their relative position in the order
    * if not exists in order doesnt matter where you put them so place in the end
    
* put orders in a vector of pairs and sort this vector with that order
* then form the output from this order by adding each char one by one 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    static bool customSort(pair<int,char> p1, pair<int,char> p2){
        return p1.first < p2.first;
    }
    string customSortString(string order, string s) {
        vector<pair<int,char>> v;
        string output = "";
        int pos;
        for(int i = 0; i<s.length(); i++){    
            if((pos = order.find(s[i])) != string::npos)
                v.push_back({pos,s[i]});
            else
                v.push_back({26,s[i]});
        }
        
        sort(v.begin(),v.end(), customSort);
        for(int i = 0; i<v.size(); i++){
            output += v[i].second;
        }
        return output;
    }
};
```
