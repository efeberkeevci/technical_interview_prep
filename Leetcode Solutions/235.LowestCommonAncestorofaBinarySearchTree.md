235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
Easy

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”


```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    /*
        Algorithm: 
            if the current node is bigger than or equal to one of p or q and 
            smaller or equal to one of p or q then return this node
        If bigger than both then recurse on left subtree
        If smaller than both then recurse on right subtree
    */
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if((root->val >= p->val && root->val <= q->val) || (root->val <= p->val && root->val >= q->val)){
            return root;
        }
        if(root->val > p->val && root->val >q->val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p,q);
        else return lowestCommonAncestor(root->right,p,q);
    }
};
```
