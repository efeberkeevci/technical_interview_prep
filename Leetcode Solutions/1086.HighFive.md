# 1086. High Five
### Easy

Given a list of the scores of different students, items, where items[i] = [IDi, scorei] represents one score from a student with IDi, calculate each student's top five average.

Return the answer as an array of pairs result, where result[j] = [IDj, topFiveAveragej] represents the student with IDj and their top five average. Sort result by IDj in increasing order.

A student's top five average is calculated by taking the sum of their top five scores and dividing it by 5 using integer division.

 
Example 1:

Input: items = [[1,91],[1,92],[2,93],[2,97],[1,60],[2,77],[1,65],[1,87],[1,100],[2,100],[2,76]]
Output: [[1,87],[2,88]]
Explanation: 
The student with ID = 1 got scores 91, 92, 60, 65, 87, and 100. Their top five average is (100 + 92 + 91 + 87 + 65) / 5 = 87.
The student with ID = 2 got scores 93, 97, 77, 100, and 76. Their top five average is (100 + 97 + 93 + 77 + 76) / 5 = 88.6, but with integer division their average converts to 88.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> highFive(vector<vector<int>>& items) {
        map<int,priority_queue<int>> mem;
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        for(int i = 0; i<items.size(); i++){
            mem[items[i][0]].push(items[i][1]);
        }
        
        map<int,priority_queue<int>>::iterator it;
        for(it = mem.begin(); it != mem.end(); it++){
            int cur_sum = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i<5; i++){
                cur_sum += it->second.top();
                it->second.pop();
            }
            vector<int> v;
            v.push_back(it->first);
            v.push_back(cur_sum/5);
            result.push_back(v);
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
