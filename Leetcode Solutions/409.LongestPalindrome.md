#Â 409. Longest Palindrome
### Easy

Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

Example 2:

Input: s = "a"
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: s = "bb"
Output: 2

Approach:
* make a map to store frequency of unique chars in s
* then sum each one's half and then return the double of that sum
* if there has been a char with odd num of frequency, add 1 to sum
    
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindrome(string s) {
        int sum = 0;
        map<char,int> mem;
        bool is_odd = false;
        for(int i = 0; i<s.length(); i++)
            mem[s[i]]++;
        map<char,int>::iterator it;
        for(it = mem.begin(); it != mem.end(); it++){
            if(it->second % 2 == 1)
                is_odd = true;
            sum += it->second / 2;
        }
        return is_odd ? sum * 2 + 1 : sum * 2;
    }
};
```
