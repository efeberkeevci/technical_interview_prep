# 1773. Count Items Matching a Rule
### Easy

You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

    ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
    ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
    ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.

Return the number of items that match the given rule.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[][]} items
 * @param {string} ruleKey
 * @param {string} ruleValue
 * @return {number}
 */
var countMatches = function(items, ruleKey, ruleValue) {
    let count = 0;
    let rule_index;
    if(ruleKey == "type") rule_index = 0;
    if(ruleKey == "color") rule_index = 1;
    if(ruleKey == "name") rule_index = 2;

    for(let i = 0; i<items.length; i++){
        if(items[i][rule_index] == ruleValue)count++;
    }
    return count;
};

```
