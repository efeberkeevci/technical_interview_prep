#Â 461. Hamming Distance
### Easy

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

Approach:
* XOR x and y
* Count the number of "1" bits and return
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        x ^= y;
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<sizeof(int)*8; i++){
            if( x == (x>>1)*2 +1)count++;
            x = x>>1;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
