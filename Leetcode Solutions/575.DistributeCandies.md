# 575. Distribute Candies
###Â Easy

Alice has n candies, where the ith candy is of type candyType[i]. Alice noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor.

The doctor advised Alice to only eat n / 2 of the candies she has (n is always even). Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the maximum number of different types of candies while still following the doctor's advice.

Given the integer array candyType of length n, return the maximum number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats n / 2 of them.

Approach:
* Create a set to store eaten candies
* While set size is smaller than n/2 and we haven't discovered all the candies yet
    * Check if the candy is eaten already, if not add to eaten candies set
* At the end of the while loop return the size of the set

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int distributeCandies(vector<int>& candyType) {
        set<int> eaten;
        int i = 0;
        while(eaten.size() < candyType.size()/2 && i<candyType.size()){
            if(eaten.find(candyType[i]) == eaten.end()){
                eaten.insert(candyType[i]);
            }
            i++;
        }
        return eaten.size();
    }
};
```
