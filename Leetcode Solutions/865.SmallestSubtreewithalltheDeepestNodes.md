# 865. Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes
### Medium

Given the root of a binary tree, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root.

Return the smallest subtree such that it contains all the deepest nodes in the original tree.

A node is called the deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The subtree of a node is tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

Note: This question is the same as 1123: https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/

 

    Example 1:

    Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
    Output: [2,7,4]
    Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
    The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.
    Notice that nodes 5, 3 and 2 contain the deepest nodes in the tree but node 2 is the smallest subtree among them, so we return it.
## Approach:
* Need to find deepest nodes and then find the lowest common ancestor and return

### Idea 1:
    * Recursively find the deepest nodes => level order traversal
    * Find the max depth, find max depth nodes
    * find their lowest common ancestor by running find from root
 * Not the most optimal solution but definetely will solve
 
### Idea 2: (Optimal Solution)
* if leaf and not deepest
    * return nullptr
 
* if another non nullptr answer comes from left or right subtrees then this one is lca
* else return non nullptr subtree return val

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* subtreeWithAllDeepest(TreeNode* root) {
        //Find max depth
        max_depth = findDepth(root);
        return helper(root,0);
    }
private:
    int max_depth;
    int findDepth(TreeNode * root){
        if(root == nullptr)
            return -1;
        else 
            return max(findDepth(root->left),findDepth( root->right))+1;
    }
    
    TreeNode * helper(TreeNode * root, int cur_depth){
        if(root == nullptr)
            return nullptr;
        if(root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr)
            if(cur_depth == max_depth)
                return root;
            else
                return nullptr;
        else{
            TreeNode * left = helper(root->left,cur_depth+1);
            TreeNode * right = helper(root->right,cur_depth+1);
            if(left != nullptr && right != nullptr)
                return root;
            else if(left !=nullptr)
                return left;
            else return
                right;
        }
    }
};
