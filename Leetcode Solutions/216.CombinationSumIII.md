# 216. Combination Sum III
### Medium

Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:
* Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.
* Each number is used at most once.

Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

```
Example 1:
Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.


Example 2:
Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 6 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
There are no other valid combinations.
```

Approach:
* If k is 0 and n is 0 add the comb to combs
* if k is smaller than 0 return
* else from begin to 9 add each number and make recursive call to the helper function with params k-1, n-i, begin = i+1, comb)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum3(int k, int n) {
        vector<int> init;
        helper(k, n, 1, init);
        return combs;
    }
private:
    vector<vector<int>> combs;
    void helper(int k, int n, int begin, vector<int> comb){
        if(k == 0 && n == 0){
            combs.push_back(comb);
        }
        if(k < 0) return;
        
        for(int i = begin; i <= 9; i++){
            comb.push_back(i);
            helper(k-1, n-i, i+1, comb);
            comb.pop_back();
        }
        return;
    }
};
