# 771. Jewels and Stones
###Â Easy

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0


```c++
#include <map>

class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) {
        //We need to frequently look up.Therefore we will construct a set with jevels
        set <char> jewels_set;
        for(int i = 0; i<jewels.size(); i++){
            jewels_set.insert(jewels.at(i));
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<stones.size(); i++){
            if(jewels_set.find(stones.at(i)) != jewels_set.end()) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};

```
