# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
### Medium

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”


Example 1:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:

Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1

Approach:
* Check if p is a child of q, if yes return q
* Check if q is a child of p, if yes return p
* While p and q is not in different subtrees of the root
    * if both in left recurse on left subtree
    * if both in right recurse on right subtree
* return root

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
private:
    bool findNode(TreeNode * root, TreeNode * target){
        if(root == nullptr) return false;
        if(root == target) return true;
        return findNode(root->left, target) || findNode(root->right, target);
    }

    
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if(findNode(p,q)) return p;
        if(findNode(q,p)) return q;
        bool pl,qr,ql,pr;
        do{
            pl = findNode(root->left, p);
            pr = findNode(root->right, p);
            ql = findNode(root->left, q);
            qr = findNode(root->right, q);
            if(pl && ql) root = root->left;
            if(pr && qr) root = root->right;
        }while(!((pl && qr) || (ql && pr)));
        return root;
    }
};



/*
Scenarios
    1) p and q is children of some other node r => r
    2) p is child of q => q
    3) q is child of p => p

Algorithm possiblities
    Starting from the root run DFS to find p and q
    run dfs from p 
        if finds q then case 3
        if q not found run dfs from q
        if finds p then case 2
        if not found case 1
            
            
Second trial
    run dfs from root
    if p found and q found in lower subtrees then return p
    if q found and p found in lower subtrees then return q
    if p and q are from right and left then the return root
    
    root == nullptr return -1
    if root->val == p return p
    if root->val == q return q
    
    
    find which subtree p and q are
    if different return root
    if same
        find p and try to find q
        if found p is lca if not q
