# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
### Easy

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

```c
int maxProfit(int* prices, int pricesSize){
    int profit = 0;
    int local_max;
    int local_min = prices[0];
    int local_min_changed = true;

    for(int i = 1; i<pricesSize; i++){
        
        //a local min is where current price is lower then to its left and to its right (if exists)
        if(i!= (pricesSize-1) && prices[i+1]>=prices[i] && prices[i]<=prices[i-1]){
            local_min = prices[i];
            local_min_changed = true;
        }
        
        //a local max is where current price is higher then its left and right (if exists)
        //when local max changes get a difference with local min and add to the profit
        if(i == (pricesSize-1) && prices[i-1]<=prices[i]){
            local_max = prices[i];
            if(local_min_changed){
                profit += local_max - local_min;
                local_min_changed = false;
            }
        }else{
            if(prices[i-1]<=prices[i] && prices[i]>=prices[i+1] ){
                local_max = prices[i];
                if(local_min_changed == true){
                    profit += local_max - local_min;
                    local_min_changed = false;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return profit;
}
