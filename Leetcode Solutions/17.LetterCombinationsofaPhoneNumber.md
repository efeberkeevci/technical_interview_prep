# 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
### Medium

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.
Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Approach:
* Use Dynamic Programming to solve the problem recursively
* Base Case: if empty string return an empty vector
* Recursive Step: 
    * Go through every element in the vector from one step down
    * And concat all 3/4 possible letters in the corresponding digit
    * Return the vector with concataneted strings

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> letterCombinations(string digits) {
        vector<string> combs;
        if(digits == ""){
            return combs;
        }
        vector<string> res = letterCombinations(digits.substr(1,digits.length()));
        if(res.size() == 0) res.push_back("");

        
        //Determine the first character that corresponds to the digit
        char cur_char_to_add = (digits[0]-'2')*3 + 'a';
        if(digits[0] >= '8') cur_char_to_add = (digits[0]-'2')*3 +1 + 'a';
        
        //Determine the number of characters possible in a digit.
        //7 and 9 have 4 characters and others have 3
        int num_of_letters = 3;
        if(digits[0] == '7' || digits[0] == '9') num_of_letters = 4;
        
        
        for(int i = 0; i<num_of_letters; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j<res.size();j++){
                combs.push_back(cur_char_to_add + res[j]);
            }
            cur_char_to_add++;
        }
        return combs;
    }
};

```
