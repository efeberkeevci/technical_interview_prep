# 1120. Maximum Average Subtree
###Â Medium

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum average value of a subtree of that tree. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants.

The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [5,6,1]
Output: 6.00000
Explanation: 
For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.
For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.
For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.
So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.

Approach:
* Declare a global variable called maxAverage
* For every node, calculate its average and if it is larger than the maxAverage make that maxAverage
* Return maxAverage

* In our helper function we need to return the sum and number of nonnull nodes to the upper level
* Thus the best way to return would be to return a pair of integers
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double maximumAverageSubtree(TreeNode* root) {
        helper(root);
        return maxAverage;
    }
private:
    double maxAverage = 0;
    pair<int,int> helper(TreeNode* root){
        if(root == nullptr)
            return {-1,0};
        int sum = root->val;
        int node_count = 1;
        pair<int,int> left = helper(root->left);
        pair<int,int> right = helper(root->right);
        if(left.second > 0){
            sum += left.first;
            node_count += left.second;
        }
        if(right.second > 0){
            sum += right.first;
            node_count += right.second;
        }
        double average = (double)sum/node_count;
        if(average > maxAverage)
            maxAverage = average;
        return {sum,node_count};
    }
};
```
