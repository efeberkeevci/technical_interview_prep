# 210. Course Schedule II
### Medium
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

    For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.


    Example 1:

    Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

    Example 2:

    Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
    Output: [0,2,1,3]
    Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
    So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

## Approach: Topological sort
* make a graph of dependencies unordered_hashmap of int and vector<int> where value is the courses that depends on this course
* make an vector of integers to represent num of dependencies of each course
* find all courses with 0 dependencies and push to the queueu
* if queue emory return empty array
    * take a course from the queue
    * remove this dependency from all the courses that depends on this course and if they have 0 dependencies push them to queueu   
* If the queue is zero but map is not return empty array
* Time Complexity => O(V+E) num of actual courses provided V and their dependencies E
