### Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are best fit for Greedy(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)

There are 2 conditions for a problem to be solved with greedy algoirthms approach:
1. Greedy - choice property: A global optimum can be reached by selecting local optimum
2. An optimal solution to the problem contains solutions to subproblem. Although this looks very similar to dynamic programming requirement, it differentiaes by not reconsidering past choices.
