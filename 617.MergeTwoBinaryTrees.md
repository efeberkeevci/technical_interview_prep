# 617. Merge Two Binary Trees
###Â Easy

You are given two binary trees root1 and root2.

Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

Return the merged tree.

Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.
Approaches:

## Algorithm Idea 1: Modified level order traversal
* For both Trees Create a modified level order traversal list, if no child at a side put null
* Then go through these levels:
* If both nodes exist merge and write to the new node
* If one of them null make the new node val equal to the nonnull one
* If both null leave as null

### Algorithm: Two pointers
* Get two pointers to the root of the trees
* If both of them are nonnull merge them and put it into the node where first node points to
* If first pointer is null make first pointer point to second tree pointer
* If the other way around dont do anything and return;

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* mergeTrees(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {

        if(root1 != nullptr && root2 != nullptr) {
            root1->val+= root2->val;
            root1->left  = mergeTrees(root1->left, root2->left);
            root1->right = mergeTrees(root1->right, root2->right);
            return root1;
        }
        if(root1 == nullptr){
            root1 = root2;
            return root2;
        }
        return root1;
    }
};
