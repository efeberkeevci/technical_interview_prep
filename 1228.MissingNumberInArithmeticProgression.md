# 1228. Missing Number In Arithmetic Progression
### Easy

In some array arr, the values were in arithmetic progression: the values arr[i + 1] - arr[i] are all equal for every 0 <= i < arr.length - 1.

A value from arr was removed that was not the first or last value in the array.

Given arr, return the removed value.

    Example 1:

    Input: arr = [5,7,11,13]
    Output: 9
    Explanation: The previous array was [5,7,9,11,13].

    Example 2:

    Input: arr = [15,13,12]
    Output: 14
    Explanation: The previous array was [15,14,13,12].

## Binary Search Approach:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& arr) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.size()-1;
        int mid;
        int diff = (arr.back() - arr[0]);
        if(diff >= 0)
            diff /= arr.size();
        else{
            diff *= -1;
            diff /= arr.size();
            diff *= -1;
        }
        while(left < right){
            mid = (left+right)/2;
            int expected_val = arr[0]+diff*mid;
            if(arr[mid] == expected_val)
                left = mid+1;
            else
                right = mid;     
        }
        return arr[0] + diff * left;
        
    }
};
```
## Math Approach: difference in actual and expected arithmetic sum
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& arr) {
        int expected_sum = (arr[0] + arr.back()) * (arr.size()+1) / 2;
        int actual_sum = 0;
        for(int num : arr){
            actual_sum += num;
        }
        return expected_sum - actual_sum;
        
    }
};
```
