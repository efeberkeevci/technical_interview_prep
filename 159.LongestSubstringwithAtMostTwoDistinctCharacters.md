# 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters
### Medium

Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters.

    Example 1:

    Input: s = "eceba"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The substring is "ece" which its length is 3.

    Example 2:

    Input: s = "ccaabbb"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: The substring is "aabbb" which its length is 5.
## Approach: Sliding Window
1. Have unordered_map where we store the frequency of two distinct chars in the current window
2. If the next char is the 3rd distinct char
    1. check if the current window is the largest
    2. move the left bound of the window forward until no such char is left in that window
3. Do 2.1 after while loop ends as well
4. Return max
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(string s) {
        int max = 1;
        unordered_map<char,int> mem;
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;

        while(right < s.length()){
            
            if(mem.find(s[right]) != mem.end() || mem.size() < 2){
                mem[s[right]]++;
            }else{
                if(max < right-left)
                    max = right-left;

                while(mem.size() > 1){
                    if(mem[s[left]] == 1){
                        mem.erase(s[left]);
                    }else
                        mem[s[left]]--;

                    left++;
                }
                mem[s[right]]++;
            }
            
            right++;
        }
        if(max < right-left)
            max = right-left;
        return max;
    }
};
