# 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings
### Easy

* You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.***
* Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.

```
Example 1:

Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.

Example 2:

Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
Output: 7
Explanation: All strings are consistent.

Example 3:

Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
Output: 4
Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.
```

## Solution
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} allowed
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {number}
 */
var countConsistentStrings = function(allowed, words) {
    let allowed_set = new Set();
    let count = 0;
    //Add allowed chars to a set for fast access
    for(let i = 0; i<allowed.length; i++){
        allowed_set.add(allowed.charAt(i));
    }
    
    //iterate through each word and check if it contains a non-allowed char.
    //if all the elements of a word is in allowed chars set increment consistent string count
    loop1:
    for(let j = 0; j<words.length; j++){
        loop2:
        for(let k = 0; k<words[j].length;k++){
            if(!allowed_set.has(words[j].charAt(k))) continue loop1;
        }
        count++;
    }
    
    return count;
}; 
```
