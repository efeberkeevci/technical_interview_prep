# 207. Course Schedule
### Medium

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

    For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 

    Example 1:

    Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
    Output: true
    Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
    To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

    Example 2:

    Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
    Output: false
    Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
    To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

## Approach: Topological Sorting
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        if(prerequisites.size() == 0)
            return true;
        int count = 0;
        queue<int> q;
        init(numCourses, prerequisites);
        
        //if there isn't a course without prereqs, that the graph is cyclic, return false
        if(initial_courses.size() == 0)
            return false;
        //push all the courses without prereq to the queue
        for(auto initial_course : initial_courses)
            q.push(initial_course);
        //while the queue is not empty, take the current course, 
        //decrement the prereq counter of the dependent courses and add that course to the queue if prereq counter for that course is 0
        while(!q.empty()){
            int cur_course = q.front();
            q.pop();
            count++;
            for(auto course : adjlist[cur_course]){

                if(prereqs[course] == 0)
                    q.push(course);
            }
        }
        //return true if we have taken all unique courses specified by prereq relationships, false otherwise
        return count == courses.size();
    }

            adjlist.push_back(v);

        }
        
        //The actual number of courses to be taken can be less then the provided number so make a set of unique courses to take
        for(auto dependency : prerequisites){

        }
        initial_courses = courses;
        
        //for every prereq increment the dependent course's prereq counter
        //if a course has dependency, remove it from the list of non-prereq courses set
        //add the dependent courses to the courses adjlist entry to later decrement their prereq count when this course is taken
        for(auto dependency : prerequisites){
            prereqs[dependency[1]]++;
            initial_courses.erase(dependency[1]);
            adjlist[dependency[0]].push_back(dependency[1]);

        return;
