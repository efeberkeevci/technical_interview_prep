# 191. Number of 1 Bits
### Easy

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example 1:

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.

Example 2:

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.

Example 3:

Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.

Approach:
* Shift the number to the left 32 times and check if the "fallen" bit is 1
* If so increment the counter and finally return it
* To check fallen bit is 1, check if the shifted version is one less than the half of the unshifted version

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<32; i++){
            if( n == (n>>1)*2 +1)count++;
            n = n>>1;
        }
        return count;
    }
};

```
