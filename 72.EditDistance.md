### Hard

Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

    Insert a character
    Delete a character
    Replace a character

    Example 1:

    Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
    rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
    rose -> ros (remove 'e')

    Example 2:

    Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: 
    intention -> inention (remove 't')
    inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
    enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
    exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
    exection -> execution (insert 'u')

## Approach: Dynamic Programming with Memoization
* This is a very similar problem to longest common subsequence
* Instead of 2 choices, we have 3 choices in this problem
* At every step we choose the one that returns the minimum number of steps => to replace the current char, to delete the current char, to add a new char

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        vector<int> v(word2.length(), -1);
        vector<vector<int>> mem(word1.length(), v);
        return helper(word1, word2, word1.length()-1, word2.length()-1, mem);
    }
private:
    
    int helper(string & word1, string & word2, int i1, int i2, vector<vector<int>> &mem){
        if(i1 == -1)
            return i2+1;
        if(i2 == -1)
            return i1+1;
        if(mem[i1][i2] != -1)
            return mem[i1][i2];
        if(word1[i1] == word2[i2])
            return helper(word1, word2, i1-1, i2-1, mem);
        else{
            //Try 3 options and pick the minimum
            //Option 1: replace
            int replace = helper(word1, word2, i1-1, i2-1, mem)+1;
            
            //Option 2: delete char
            int delete_char = helper(word1, word2, i1-1, i2, mem)+1;
            
            //Option 3: insert a char
            int insert_char = helper(word1, word2, i1, i2-1, mem)+1;
            int result = min(replace, min(delete_char, insert_char));
            mem[i1][i2] = result;
            return result;
        }
    }
};
```
