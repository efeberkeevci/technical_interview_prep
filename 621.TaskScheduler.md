# 621. Task Scheduler
###Â Medium

Given a characters array tasks, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.

Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

 

    Example 1:

    Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
    Output: 8
    Explanation: 
    A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
    There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.

    Example 2:

    Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
    Output: 6
    Explanation: On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.
    ["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
    ["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
    ["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
    ...
    And so on.

    Example 3:

    Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
    Output: 16
    Explanation: 
    One possible solution is
    A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A

Approach:
* create a queue with n empty entrie
* create a heap where the top item is the task with most occurences
* pick the top item and place it in the queue if num of that task is bigger than 1
* only add the task back to the heap when it exits in the queue

```
while heap is not empty
    if(heap is not empty)
        get the top element from heap
        add to the queue with freq-1 if freq >1
    else
        add idle to the queue
    pop the queue and add to heap if freq is not zero
    increment time counter
    return time - n
```

        }
