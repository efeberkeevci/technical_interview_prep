# 563. Binary Tree Tilt
### Easy

Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of every tree node's tilt.

The tilt of a tree node is the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and all right subtree node values. If a node does not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node values is treated as 0. The rule is similar if the node does not have a right child.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTilt(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == nullptr)
            return 0;
        else
            helper(root);
            return result;
    }
private:
    int result = 0;
    int helper(TreeNode * root){
        if(root == nullptr)
            return 0;
        int left = helper(root->left);
        int right = helper(root->right);
        
        result += abs(left - right);
        return left + right + root->val;
    }
};
```
