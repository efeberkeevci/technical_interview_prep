# 1539. Kth Missing Positive Number
###Â Easy

Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.

Find the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findKthPositive(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int i = 0;
        int supposed_to_be_item = 1;
        while(k > 0 ){
            if(supposed_to_be_item != arr[i])
                k--;
            else if (i < arr.size()-1)
                i++;
            supposed_to_be_item++;
        }
        return supposed_to_be_item-1;
    }
};
```
